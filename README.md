# The-Osteo-Web
A Hip Implant designed for patients of Osteoporosis. 
We were given a patient's case file and were tasked to design a Hip Implant that caters to their needs and requirements. 
Our need statement was "Design and model a long-lasting and lightweight implant for Diane that allows her to return to her active lifestyle. This should accomodate for the bone loss and fatigue she experiences from osteoporosis. "

Process:

With this need statement in mind, the team individually created concept sketches of the implant. Each and every sketch was different and contributed in some way to the overall design. Mine leaned more toward the hip implant's overall form factor and practicality as I wanted to prioritize form and function before focusing on aspects that made the design unique. Eventually, we settled on a “web” form design that would theoretically allow the force received by the implant to be distributed at the “web” area.
After weighing the pros and cons of our design, we began to move on to the materials selection of the structure. Each of us conducted our own research on different materials and their respective properties to conclude what would be the most suitable for different parts of our implant. We settled on Polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) due to its biocompatibility and low density.

As a part of the Computing team, I worked alongside my partner Andrew to compile a code that would test the stress levels of the hip implant given an inputted pressure.
